## Installation

To get started with the development of this portfolio website, follow the steps below:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/n4en/n4en-portfolio.git
    cd n4en-portfolio
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
    Make sure you have Node.js installed. Then run:
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

## Development

To start the development server with hot reloading, run:
```sh
npm run dev
```

This will start the Vite development server, and you can view the application in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Building

To create a production build of the project, run:
```sh
npm run build
```

This will compile the TypeScript code and bundle the application for production using Vite.

## Linting

To lint the project files using ESLint, run:
```sh
npm run lint
```

This will check the code for any linting errors based on the rules specified in the ESLint configuration.

## Formatting

To format the code using Prettier, run:
```sh
npm run format
```

This will format all the files in the `src` directory (including JavaScript, TypeScript, JSON, CSS, SCSS, and Markdown files) according to the Prettier configuration.

## Preview

To preview the production build locally, run:
```sh
npm run preview
```

This will start a local server to serve the built files, allowing you to test the production build of your application.
